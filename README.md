# smtpwebrelay.js

Send email from your static web pages with a simple JavaScript call using your own SMTP server.

## What does it do ?
Same as any other library proposing this feature, we use our own server to relay the email between your web page and your smtp server.
Unlike most libraries, this one is open source and you can build your own server easily using our code. You can now check the code to ensure that we are not sending your server details anywhere. We are not saving the details and we are not demanding the connection details for any other reason than to send your emails using the service.

### Donate
You may have guessed it, I have to maintain a server to run this service. The service being small and well coded, it does not require much per user/email, but in the spirit of open source and helping others, I want to keep it free for anybody that needs it. Too often have I struggled with that problem before! If you can, help me maintain this code and open server to keep at least one open source solution running.
